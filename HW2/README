Did you complete any extra-credit tasks? If so, which ones?
 Extra credits : 
  multi-threaded server, User subscription (only a part of it -
  The users can subscribe and unsubscribe to different channels.
  I do not highlight the channels for which new documents have been matched.)

Any special instructions for building and running your solution?
 I added couple of more packages(edu.upenn.cis455.components, edu.upenn.cis455.dbobjects
 edu.upenn.cis455.dbservice) - and accordingly edited
 the build.xml.  The build works fine. I used Jetty to run my serlvet. Hence copied the web.xml into HW2/conf folder. The
 file mappings are in that web.xml. The starting servlet in my case in LoginServlet which
 is mapped to "/login".

Once you create a user and login, you can add channel. Multiple xpaths
are seperated by ";"(semicolon) operator.
A logged in user sees all the channels. But he can only view the xml for a corresponding channel if either
he is a owner or a subscriber to a channel. Also if the xslt url is not correct
the xml does not displayed.I used Jetty for testing my servlets.
In that I places the rss.xsl inside the context path folder(Crawler in my case)
but outside the WEB-INF.

 The tests are in package - test.edu.upenn.cis455. RunAllTests calls these tests.
 
 The rss.xsl and warandpeace.xp are inside the rss folder.

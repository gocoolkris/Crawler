  Entire Assignment(No extra credits)	

Did you complete any extra-credit tasks? If so, which ones?
  None

Any special instructions for building and running your solution?
 I added couple of more packages(edu.upenn.cis455.validator, edu.upenn.cis455.httpclient) - and accordingly edited
 the build.xml. I used Jetty to run my serlvet. Hence copied the web.xml into HW2/conf folder. Please note that
 the name of the servlet used is XPathServlet and the url is "/xpathservlet" and not "/xpath".

 The tests are in package - test.edu.upenn.cis455. RunAllTests calls these tests. Since I used bunch of helper classes
 I tested them - GrammarValidator, XPathValidator. 
 
 The build works fine.
